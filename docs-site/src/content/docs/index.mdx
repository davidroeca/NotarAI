## What is NotarAI?

NotarAI is a continuous intent reconciliation tool that keeps your specs, code, and documentation in sync as all three evolve. It uses LLMs as a bidirectional reconciliation engine: not just to generate code from specs, but to detect drift, surface conflicts, and propose updates across your entire artifact chain.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Spec-anchored" icon="document">
    Structured YAML specs capture intent as the canonical source of truth,
    validated by JSON Schema.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bidirectional" icon="random">
    Detects drift in any direction (code, spec, or docs) and proposes aligned
    updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Propose & approve" icon="approve-check">
    Never auto-syncs. All changes are proposed for human review.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable" icon="puzzle">
    Specs reference each other via `$ref` for hierarchical and cross-cutting
    composition.
